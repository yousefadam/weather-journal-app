Credentials:

Server-side:

- The server is running on port 3000

- Express, CORS, and bodyparser are used to set up the app. 
- GET and POST routes are created to post and retrieve data.

- An object was created to act as an endpoint.



Client-side:

- Async POST and GET functions are created to fetch data.

- An event listener was applied to the "generate" button to perform the desired action, which is to get the data from the OpenWeatherMap server, the date, the feeling that the user enters and collect them in an object to send it to the server.

- An alert is shown if the user does not enter a Zip Code.



Dynamic UI:

- The temperature, date, and the user's content is displayed on the UI when the button "Generate" is clicked.
